// we can append data to an array using the push command in JavaScript
// For Example, let's append one array to the end of another array, we would do this with the following command

var Array = ["Hello", 20, "World!"]
var pushArray = ["Mohammed", "Haq"]
Array.push(pushArray)

console.log(Array)

// we do not have to set the array equal to the array.push because it automatically does this
// pushing function appends item to the end of the array, this is similar to a queue data structure

DOM - Document Object Model
-----------------------------

a Document object model describes the way you use JavaScript to interact with your website

The HTML document acts as a JavaScript object when being used in JavaScript

for example, the real thing is the line that says the <h2>....
whereas the model is document.getElementById("...")

the document object model in JavaScript has many already in-built functions that allow it to interact, modify, create, and delete data on a website page.
